# RPOMDPs.jl
This is a fork of the Julia 0.6 version of POMDPs.jl that has been edited to be compatible with robust POMDPs in addition to standard POMDPs. It is primarily used as an interface.

## Installation
This application is built for Julia 0.6. If not already installed, the application can be cloned using the `ajk/robust` branch of the fork.

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/ajkeith/RPOMDPs.jl/tree/ajk/robust")
```

## Usage

RPOMDPs provides type structure and an interface to the components in [RPOMDPModels.jl](https://github.com/ajkeith/RPOMDPModels.jl), [RPOMDPToolbox.jl](https://github.com/ajkeith/RPOMDPToolbox.jl), and [RobustValueIteration](https://github.com/ajkeith/RobustValueIteration). See each application for futher details.

## References
RPOMDPs.jl is a branch of a fork of [POMDPs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPOMDP/POMDPs.jl), which extends the type structure to allow robust models.
